A Brief Introduction
======================
Background

This is a post outlining a ShinyApp that I made for visualising inter-participant agreement on quesions relating to Haidtâ€™s Moral Foundations (e.g., Haidt and Joseph 2008). This is part of a line of research on moral judgements, inspired by DAFINET project, where I aim to investigate the role of agreement with others in the robustness of moral judgements. It is very early days and for the moment I am just playing around with the possible methods.

I created a ShinyApp to look at this further. Currently the app only works with 1 specific dataset that I downloaded from the OSF (see here), however I have plans to update it to make it possible to upload your own datasets.
